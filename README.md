# Car Showroom Management System

## Overview

Welcome to the Car Showroom Management System repository! This desktop-based application aims to streamline the operations of a car showroom, offering a comprehensive solution for managing car inventory, and Test drive processes. By utilizing effective data structures and algorithms, the system provides a reliable platform for both showroom staff and customers, enhancing the overall experience of buying and selling cars

## Features
1. **Efficient Car Showroom Management:** Utilize a graph representation for car models and manufacturers to establish relationships within the showroom.
2. **Streamlined Car Information Retrieval:** Implement sorting algorithms for quick retrieval and organization of car details based on various attributes like price or mileage.
3. **Fast and Secure User Authentication:** Hashing for secure storage and retrieval of user credentials, ensuring a robust sign-up and sign-in system.
4. **Organized Car Inventory:** Utilize AVL trees for efficient organization and navigation of the car inventory based on hierarchical categories and models.
5. **Structured User Interaction History:** Implement a stack to manage user interactions, allowing for easy navigation through different sections of the application.
6. **Optimized Test Drive Queue:** Use a queue to manage the waiting list for customers interested in test drives, ensuring a fair and organized process.
7. **Reliable Data Persistence:** File handling for saving and loading data, ensuring persistent storage of car details and user information between application runs.
8. **Graceful Error Handling:** Implement try-catch blocks for handling errors gracefully, providing informative messages to users in case of issues.
9.**Efficient Manufacturer-wise Car Exploration:** Incorporate BFS and DFS algorithms to enable efficient exploration of car models based on their manufacturers, offering a systematic approach for users.
10. **Comprehensive Search and Sorting:** Utilize binary search, linear search, quicksort, and mergesort for advanced search and sorting functionalities based on various car attributes such as price, mileage, etc.
11. **Secure User Authentication:** Implement a secure sign-up and sign-in system with password hashing, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of user credentials.
13. **Dynamic Rehashing:** Implement dynamic rehashing in the hash table to ensure optimal performance and handling of collisions during user and car data management.

## Technical Details
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Database Management:** Local database 
- **User Interface:** Desktop application with an intuitive GUI for users.

## Requirements
### Dependencies
- Python
- Appropriate GUI libraries
- Local database

### Data Structures and Algorithms
1. **Graphs:** For car models and manufacturers to establish relationships within the showroom.
2. **Sorting Algorithms:** For quick retrieval and organization of car details.
3. **Hashing:** For secure storage and retrieval of user credentials.
4. **Queue:**  Maintain a queue for test drives, with customers enqueued as they express interest and dequeued as they take their turn.
5. **Trees:** Efficient organization and navigation of the car inventory.
6. **Binary Search/Linear Search:** Efficient search operations.
7. **File Handling:** Data persistence and backup.
8. **Stack:** For navigating through car details or viewing previous selections.
9. **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):** to optimize the layout of the showroom floor. This can help minimize the distance customers need to cover when exploring different car models.


## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab.com/test6374834/dsafinalproject-pid11

2. **Install Dependencies:**
Follow the installation  
- Install the interpreter of Python language
- pip install Pyqt5
- pip install pandas
- pip install matplotlib 
(Your system  will be ready to run this application after these 4 steps.)

3. **Run the Application**
- Execute the main application file main.py for Python.
- For execution on cmd, write following command:
  ```bash
  python main.py

## Packages and Libraries
- PyQT5 (version 5.15.9) has been used for designing the User Interface.
- Python (version 23.2.1) is used for programming.
- "matplotlib" libraries of Python have been used for visualization of map of all Cars.

## Usage
Follow the prompts and menus within the application.
Enjoy the experience provided by the Car showroom Management System.
